Needed Information
==================

(Place the number or numbers of the script(s) that gather (part of) the required information between brackets)

- The total number of news-items per decade within the pre-defined dataset (script 2)

- The total number of news-items per decade  within the NY-Times API (script 1)

- The total number of front-page articles per decade within the pre-defined dataset (script 2)

- The total number of front-page articles per decade within the NY-Times API (script 1)

- A percentual oversight of the number of NY-Times front-page articles in relation to the total number of NY-Times news-items (possibly excluding blogs) per decade // This is needed to establish wheter the percentage of humanities articles that was placed on the front-page before the 60's was relativly equal to the high-amount of articles in the 60's and 70's. If the percentage is (close to) equal, this means we will also need to take the pre-1960 decades into account. 

- A percentual oversight of the number of NY-Times front-page articles about Humanities in relation to the total number of NY-Times news-items about Humanities per decade

- A way of topic-modeling to check the development of article-subjects. We need to find out wheter certain specific topics where related to the apparent rise of Humanities front-page-articles in the 60's and 70's.

- Figure out a way to find out if the placement of specific topic-related words within certain fields within the article (e.g. headline or first paragraph) makes it more likely for a (humanities) article to be placed on the front page. 

- We need to create an oversight of all the headlines of all the articles that where placed on the front-page together with the front-page humanaities articles. That we we can check whether there exist(ed) some related topics that somehow helped the humanities articles to be placed on the front-page alongside them.
