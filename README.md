Partial scripts that tackle sub-questions of our research

## Script 1

This script draws information from the NY-Times article-search API. 

It defines the total number of news-items hidden within the dataset that is attached to the API. 

It defines the total number of front-page articles within the dataset that is attached to the API. 

It prints the results into the command-line interface. 

## Script 2

This script creates 2 textfiles: 

The first textfile encapsulates the total number of news-items within the pre-defined NY-Times dataset that have "The New York Times" listed as a source. It counts these articles per decade. 

The second textfile encapsulates the total number of front-page articles within the pre-defined NY-Times dataset that have "The New York Times" listed as a source. It should be noted that all front-page articles within the pre-defined dataset have "The New York Times" listed as a source, so no specific filter is applied for this. It counts the articles per decade. 

An echo-line prints an explanation-line to lable the retrieved data. 

The results are printen beneath the explanationline by pasting the two previously created text-files.
