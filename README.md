Partial scripts that tackle sub-questions of our research

## Script 1

This script draws information from the NY-Times article-search API. 

It defines the total number of news-items hidden within the dataset that is attached to the API. 

It defines the total number of front-page articles within the dataset that is attached to the API. 

It prints the results into the command-line interface. 

# Developments needed: 

Instead of the total number of ALL news-items it should rule out blogs, since those form a very specific type of news-item that only came into excistence over the last few decades. They do not form part of the actual newspaper. Or do they? Somebody willing to find out?

Can someone figure out a way to show the results per decade?

## Script 2

This script creates 2 textfiles: 

The first textfile encapsulates the total number of news-items within the pre-defined NY-Times dataset that have "The New York Times" listed as a source. It counts these articles per decade. 

The second textfile encapsulates the total number of front-page articles within the pre-defined NY-Times dataset that have "The New York Times" listed as a source. It should be noted that all front-page articles within the pre-defined dataset have "The New York Times" listed as a source, so no specific filter is applied for this. It counts the articles per decade. 

An echo-line prints an explanation-line to lable the retrieved data. 

The results are printed beneath the explanation-line by pasting the two previously created text-files.
